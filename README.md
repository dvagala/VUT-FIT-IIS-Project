# IIS project

This was my school project in course IIS (Information Systems) in VUT FIT. It's basically a web application for ordering food from restaurant. Backend written in PHP. 

It's supposed to work on our faculty server Merlin, but if you specify a host server at /dbConnect.php it should be fine. To make it work you need to have an SQL server, and pass the credentials at /dbConnect.php.
